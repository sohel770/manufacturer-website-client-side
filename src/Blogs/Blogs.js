                    <li><strong>Local (UI) state:</strong> Local state is data we manage in one or another component.</li>
                    <li><strong>Global (UI) state:</strong> Global state is data we manage across multiple components.</li>
                    <li><strong>Server state :</strong> Data that comes from an external server that must be integrated with our UI state. </li>
                    <li><strong>URL state:</strong>Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query parameters.</li>

                    <h4 className='mt-4 text-xl text-primary'>How does prototypical inheritance work?
                    </h4>
                    <p>prototypical inheritance refers to the ability to access object properties from another object. We use a JavaScript prototype to add new properties and methods to an existing object constructor. We can then essentially tell our JS code to inherit properties from a prototype. Prototypical inheritance allows us to reuse the properties or methods from one JavaScript object to another through a reference pointer function.</p>

                    </h4>
                    <p>If you update it directly, calling the setState() afterward may just replace the update you made.
                        When you directly update the state, it does not change this.state immediately. Instead, it creates a pending state transition, and accessing it after calling this method will only return the present value.
                        You will lose control of the state across all components.</p>

                    </h4>
                    <p>A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property. The isolated part of the definition is important.  test.One of the benefits of unit tests is that they isolate a function, class or method and only test that piece of code. Higher quality individual components create overall system resiliency. Thus, the result is reliable code. Unit tests also change the nature of the debugging process</p>
